### Hey there 👋
> I'm a web app and mobile developer. Lately I've been busy building user facing web applications that interface with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (NAV).

### Stack
> I cut my teeth on the LAMP stack, and have some experience with Angular, but I've been leaning towards the MERN stack lately for web apps.

### Hobbies
> It's really a toss up between building routed networks at home with old cisco routers, micing up an instrument to record some music, or delving into some documentaries on classical history.
